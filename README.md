# What is blogifier?
### Blogifier is a Drupal 8 distribution tended for Blogging purposes. 
Need a clean blog? Get that from this minimal Drupal 8 distribution. 
Blogifier is made on Materialize CSS and some scratch work.
This comes with many features that are provided by contrib modules in Drupal

# Features:
### Path-auto support.
##### Get even more customised links for your posts and share them in human readable format

### Admin toolbar
##### No need to wait to move to some/admin/section. Just jump there with this amazing and handy module

### Paragraphs
##### Paragraphs is the new way of content creation! It allows us to make things cleaner so that we can give more editing power to our end-users

### Redirect
##### Along with the Pathauto module, most websites benefit from using Redirect to take users to pages if and when the paths change. 

### Metatag
##### Metatag makes sure that your content looks cool when you share it on any social media platform

### Video-embed field
#### Got a video to share again? This functionality from this module will allow you to embed videos from YouTube and Vimeo and show their thumbnail previews simply by entering the video's url.

# Themes
#### This Drupal 8 distribution comes with a light grey-white default theme, that feels cool to eyes. With a parallax twist in the header, this Drupal 8 theme (blogifier_default) is worth trying. New themes will be added occasionally. Also in seperate repositories.
